 ## How to run
 1. Load up the repository files in the Unity game engine.
 2. Initiate a Conda virtual environment using the requirements.txt inside the python folder. 
 3. Run simulator, then immediately execute python script within the python folder (ensure python interpreter is the newly created conda virtual env) in order to enable socket communication. 
 4. Gates should now be fully functional.
