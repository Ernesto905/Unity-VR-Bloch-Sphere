 ## How to run
 1. Load up the repository files in the Unity game engine.
 2. Initiate a Conda virtual environment using the requirements.txt inside the python folder. The reason for running this script is to take advantage of Qiskit's QuantumCircuit class and it's inbuilt statevector method which utilizes numpy's complex number systems and performs the behind the scenes mathematics for rotating the qubit's vector.  
 3. Run simulator in the unity engine, then execute the python script within the python folder (ensure python interpreter is the newly created conda virtual env) in order to enable socket communication. 
 4. Gates should now be fully functional.
